* Use EventEmitter instead of convoluted promise thing
* Update `syncs` in client when on /live
* Actually tell user when a particular thread failed to sync
* Copy thread:* messages to SUBS.live instead of using another redis
  subscriber (would halve redis pubsub bandwidth)
* Extract common fields (num, op, type) from log (since these are duplicated in
  publications for filtering)
