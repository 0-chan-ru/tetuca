* Update `syncs` in client when on /live
* Actually tell user when a particular thread failed to sync
* Extract common fields (num, op, type) from log (since these are duplicated in
  publications for filtering)
* Back button broken (old cached version shown)
* Fucking text
* Not sure if the syncing in pageX threads is broken
* Look for memory leaks in the front page
  * Also redis connection count
* When navigating away from a page, commit any outstanding text
